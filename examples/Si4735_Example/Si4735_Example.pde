* Si4735 Example Sketch
* Written by Ryan Owens for SparkFun Electronics
*
* This example sketch illustrates how to use some of the basic commands in the
* Si4735 Library. The sketch will start the Si4735 in FM mode and tune to 97.3 MHz.
* The user can use a serial terminal to send characters (which correspond to basic commands) to the radio.
* The Si4735_SerialExample sketch allows you to send your own commands
* from the serial port. More information on the Si4735 chip can be found in the datasheet.
*
* HARDWARE SETUP:
* This sketch assumes you are using the Si4735 Shield from SparkFun Electronics. 
* The shield should be plugged into an Arduino Main Board (Uno, Duemillinove or similar).
*
* USING THE SKETCH:
* Once you've plugged the Si4735 Shield into your Arduino board, connect the Arduino to your computer
* and select the corresponding board and COM port from the Tools menu and upload the sketch. After
* the sketch has been updated, open the serial terminal using a 9600 bps baud speed. The sketch accepts
* single character commands (just enter the character and press 'send'). Here is a list of the acceptable commands:
* 8 - Increase the volume
* 2 - Decrease the volume
* 4 - Seek down to the next channel
* 6 - Seek up to the next channel
* m - Mute the radio
* u - Unmute the radio
* s - Get the current status of the Si4735 (learn more about the status response in the datasheet)
* r - Get the response of the latest command from the Si4735 (learn more about the command responses in the datasheet).
*
* NOTES:
* This sketch uses the Si4735 in FM mode. Other modes are AM, SW and LW. Check out the datasheet for more information on these
* modes. All of the functions in the library will work regardless of which mode is being used; however the user must indicate
* which mode is to be used in the begin() function. See the library documentation for more information.

//Add the Si4735 Library to the sketch.

// are not included here, in your application, the Si4735 Library will not be able
// to find them later.  Also, you should comment out any libraries not needed.
// Otherwise, they will waste memory.
//#include "SPI.h"  //SPI class needed by Si4735 Library when using the SPI bus
#include "Wire.h"  //Wire class needed by Si4735 Library when using the I2C bus
